1. ### What is RShiny?

   RShiny is an open-source web application framework written in R for developing web applications.

   It's designed to create interactive, web-based dashboards, data visualizations, and interactive web applications without requiring extensive knowledge of web development languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

   It was announced by Joe Cheng, CTO of Pozit (formerly RStudio), in 2012.

2. ### What are the benefits of using RShiny?

   It is easy to use, even for users with no prior experience in web development.

   It provides a number of built-in features that make it easy to create interactive web applications.

   It is scalable, so you can create Shiny apps of any size or complexity.

   It is open source, so there is a large community of users and developers who can help you if you need assistance.

3. ### What is the basic structure of R Shiny Applicaton?

   A Shiny application consists of two main parts: a user interface (UI) and a server. The UI defines the layout and appearance, while the server defines the app's behavior and functionality.

4. ### What is the difference between ui and server functions in Shiny?

   The UI function in Shiny constructs the user interface, specifying layout and appearance elements such as inputs, outputs, and formatting. On the other hand, the server function houses the application's logic and reactive behavior, handling input changes, calculations, and dynamic updates of output based on user interactions or other data modifications.

   The UI sets up the visual structure, while the server controls the dynamic functionality, enabling a seamless interactive experience for users.

5. ### What is reactive expression in the context of R Shiny?

   A reactive expression is an expression that returns a value that can change over time in response to user input or other events.
   Reactive expressions are used to create reactive values, which are values that can change over time.

   In Shiny, reactive expressions are used to create reactive values that can be used to update the output of a Shiny app in response to user input or other events.

6. ### How to create a reactive expression in Shiny?

   A reactive expression is a function that evaluates to a value and then updates its value whenever any of its dependencies change. To create a reactive expression in Shiny, you can use the `reactive()` function.

   ```R
   avg <- reactive({
    (x + y) / 2
   })

   avg()
   ```

7. ### What is the purpose of the `render()` function in Shiny?

   The `render()` function in Shiny is used to render the user interface of an app. To render a widget, we can use the render() function and pass it the widget as an argument.

   For example, the following code renders a text output widget that displays the value of the avg reactive expression:

   ```R
   renderText({
     avg()
   })
   ```

8. ### What is the purpose of the observe() function in Shiny?

   The `observe()` function in Shiny is used to run code whenever a reactive expression updates its value.

   To observe a reactive expression, we can use the `observe()` function and pass it the reactive expression as an argument.

   For example, the following code observes the avg reactive expression and prints its value to the console whenever it updates:

   ```R
   observe ({

   print(avg())

   })
   ```

9. ### How do we pass data from the UI to the server in Shiny?

   To pass data from the UI to the server in Shiny, we can use the `input$` object. The `input$` object contains a list of all of the input values in the UI.

   For example, the following code gets the value of the x input widget and assigns it to the x variable in the server:

   ```R
   x <- input$x
   ```

10. ### How to pass data from the server to the UI in Shiny?

    To pass data from the server to the UI in Shiny, we can use the `output$` object. The `output$` object contains a list of all of the output widgets in the UI.

    For example, the following code assigns the value of the avg reactive expression to the `avg_output` output widget:

    ```R
    output$avg_output <- avg()
    ```
